üë®‚Äçüíª About Me<br><br>Hi! I'm Salem, a second-year student at Epitech, passionate about coding, problem-solving, and cybersecurity. I have a solid background in C, C++, and Python, and I'm currently learning Haskell, Angular, and networking. I recently built my first project with React and Vite, [*Quelques instants avant l‚Äôaube*](https://poems-zeta.vercel.app/), a website showcasing my poetry and writings, which taught me a lot about front-end development. I actively participate in CTFs to sharpen my skills.
